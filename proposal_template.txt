# Project Name
#### Student Name: Evan Mockler   Student ID: 20046295

TODO: 
My project will involve turning the Pi into a tool to locate the planets based on your location. I will then
show some indication on the LED's that the Pi is facing in the correct position for the planet required.


## Tools, Technologies and Equipment
Outside of the Pi and SenseHat I may use a small screen for interaction or I may just use the LED display along with the joystick. 


TODO: Write a list of things you propose to use in your work. This can be hardware, programming languages etc.

I will be using python to program. As I will need to calculate the orientation of the Pi there will be a need for using the
accelerometer, gyroscope & magnetometer. I was thinking of using the skyfield python package(https://pypi.org/project/skyfield/) to
aid me with locating the respective planets. 



## Project Repository
TODO: Create a repository for your project. You can add this proposal to it!
